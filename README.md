# Starchives

## Description

[Starchives](https://starchives.org) is a website that allows anyone to search for videos on the Star Citizen YouTube channel by caption using a word or phrase. The site finds all uses of the search word or phrase within every video uploaded to the channel, then returns those videos to the user, including timestamps to every instance of the search word or phrase in each video.

In the interest of education and easier access to publicly available information, I have made this project open-source.


## Features

### Home Page
The user can filter videos by year and duration (more to come later), and order videos by date, views, likes, or duration, in either ascending or descending order. There are a set of "Caveats" detailing the limits of the site, and a set of "Tips" to help users make effective searches.

### About Page
The website's purpose and motivation are written in detail. There is a section of "frequently asked questions" which contains a list of questions I would most anticipate from any user of the site. My personal statement is given, along with links to sign up at RSI with my referral code, donate, and contact my site email directly. There is also a built-in form for users to contact me easily (and anonymously, should they prefer to do so).

### Footer
There are links to several relevant resources in the footer, both official and unofficial, that I feel might be of use to users of Starchives. There is also a disclaimer where credit is given to Cloud Imperium Games for the RSI and Star Citizen intellectual properties, and to me for the creation of Starchives. The "Made by the Community" logo, when clicked, directs users to an actively maintained comprehensive list of other Star Citizen Community projects.
