                <h4>The Problem</h4>
                <p class="text-start">
                    At the time of writing this, there are over 1500 uploads on the Star Citizen YouTube 
                    channel, ranging anywhere from 30 seconds to over an hour in length. When discussing the game, 
                    people will often bring up topics mentioned in one or more videos uploaded years ago. With 
                    multiple weekly uploads over the years, so much has been spoken by CIG that people wanting to 
                    provide sources for their info will have an exceedingly difficult time doing so if they don't 
                    know the particular video.
                </p>

                <h4>The Solution</h4>
                <p class="text-start">
                    With the help of YouTube's auto-generated captions (and those provided by CIG, when available), 
                    this changes. This site allows anyone to search a database of all videos on the Star Citizen channel 
                    and their associated captions to quickly find the info they're searching for. Timestamps to all 
                    occurrences are provided for search terms that have a match. Searching for any 
                    mention of future plans, bespoke, or ships that punch above their weight class should now take minutes, not hours, 
                    of combing through videos. Additionally, video stats are provided so anyone can see which 
                    videos have been the most far-reaching, what the community has been most interested in, and more.
                </p>

                <h4>Additional Benefits</h4>
                <p class="text-start">
                    Furthermore, being an <i>archive</i>, this site acts as a hub for many Star Citizen info resources that anyone may 
                    find useful at one time or another. At the bottom of the page, you'll find external links to several official RSI materials, as 
                    well as some of my favorite Star Citizen community projects, containing particularly useful information about all 
                    aspects of the game and its development.
