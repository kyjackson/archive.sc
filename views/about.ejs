                <p class="text-start">
                    At the time of writing this, there are over 1500 videos uploaded to the Star Citizen YouTube 
                    channel, ranging anywhere from 30 seconds to over an hour in length. When discussing the game, 
                    people will often bring up something mentioned in one or more videos uploaded years ago. With 
                    multiple weekly uploads over the years, so much has been spoken by CIG that people wanting to 
                    provide sources for their claims will have an exceedingly difficult time doing so if they don't 
                    know the particular video.
                </p>

                <p class="text-start">
                    With the help of YouTube's auto-generated captions, this changes. This site allows anyone to 
                    search a database of all videos on the Star Citizen channel and their associated captions to 
                    quickly find the info they're searching for. Full transcriptions of each video are provided, 
                    along with timestamps for search terms that have a match. Searching for any mention of future 
                    plans, bespoke, or ships that punch above their weight class should now take minutes, not hours, 
                    of combing through videos. Additionally, search stats and video stats will soon be provided so 
                    anyone can see what the community has been most interested in.

                    Thank you for visiting my site. The amazing developers at CIG and the warm Star Citizen community 
                    both inspire me every day to pursue my goals in software 
                    development. This site is among the first of hopefully many fruits to result from that inspiration.
